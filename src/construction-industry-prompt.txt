Before providing your final analysis, wrap your analysis inside <extraction_process> tags. 

In this analysis:
1. For each piece of required information:
- Quote the relevant text from the PDF content.
- Explain your reasoning for extracting this information called claude reasoning.
- If the information is ambiguous or missing, explain why.
- Convert CO2 emissions into tons in the number format x.xxx t CO2e.
- Double-check each extracted piece of information against the original content, noting any discrepancies or uncertainties.
- Ensure all required fields are filled or marked as 'Not found' or 'Unclear' if the information isn't available.

After your analysis, present your findings using the following XML structure:

Remember:
- Generate the results in the language of the PDF, German or English.
- Read through the entire content carefully before extracting information.
- Look for clear headings or labels that indicate each piece of information.
- The company is typically shown on the front page of the PDF or in the document name.
- Actions are sustainability actions, which the construction company has implemented internally inside the company or in their supply chain with suppliers.
- Solutions are construction products, services or building techniques, which the company offers helping its customers to become more sustainable in the respective criteria.
- Extract actions and solutions for a criteria and list them by importance, starting first with solutions for customers before listing actions.
- The list items should start with #.
- Only list actions and solutions which exist. 
- If not a single action or solution can be found, write ""no action found"".
- Each list item should have not more than 150 characters.
- Each list item should be formulated as bullet points wording in one phrase on the point.
- Each list item should be formulated using original wording of the company from the report.
- Carbon footprint greenhouse gas emission numbers should be converted into CO2 equivalents in tons in #.### t CO2e format.
- The carbon footprint is usually presented a chapter called climate, climate protection or indicators.
- In other sustainability initiatives should cover only topics not covered before by other criteria.
- Pay special attention to sustainable construction practices, low-carbon building materials, and construction waste management.
- Look for metrics on embodied carbon in building materials and construction processes.
- Describe only controversies, if a controversy is described in the report or in public media. Otherwise leave blank.
