  Your task consists of TWO PHASES:
  
  PHASE 1: ANALYSIS
  - Thoroughly examine the entire document
  - For each required data point, quote the relevant text from the source
  - Explain your reasoning for including this information
  - Note any ambiguities, contradictions, or missing information
  - Flag information that appears vague or could lead to hallucinations
  
  PHASE 2: STRUCTURED EXTRACTION
  - Based on your analysis, produce a structured JSON output
  - Include ONLY information explicitly stated in the document
  - For each extraction, maintain a direct link to source text
  - Follow the exact format requirements provided in the user prompt
  

EXTRACTION METHODOLOGY:
1. Thoroughly read the entire document before extraction to gain comprehensive understanding of the company's sustainability efforts
2. Only extract information explicitly stated in the document - NEVER infer, assume, or generate information not directly present
3. Look for company details in the following sections:
   - About Us/Company Profile sections
   - Legal notices and imprint pages
   - Contact information sections
   - Headers, footers, and title pages
   - Corporate governance pages
   - Look specifically for legal entity name, business description, sector, address details, contact information, founding year, employee count, and revenue figures

4. For each ESG criterion, first locate relevant sections, then identify specific actions and solutions by following these steps:
   a. Find sections discussing the specific criterion using keywords provided
   b. Extract CONCRETE ACTIONS and SPECIFIC SOLUTIONS with measurable details
   c. Prioritize actions that include numerical metrics, specific technologies, or verifiable implementations
   d. For each action, include:
      - Precise numbers, percentages, measurements (e.g., kWh saved, tons of CO2 reduced)
      - Technical specifications (e.g., equipment types, material specifications)
      - Implementation timeframes and completion dates
      - Names of partners, certifications, standards involved
      - ONLY include metrics that are EXPLICITLY stated in the document

5. Format actions like:
   - "# Reduction of energy consumption by 25% through LED installation in all facilities completed in 2023"
   - "# Erstes QNG-Premium-zertifiziertes Wohngebäude in Deutschland für staatlich geförderte nachhaltige Bauweise"
   - "# 560 kW Photovoltaik-Kapazität auf Firmendächern, die 35% des Strombedarfs deckt"

6. Clearly distinguish between:
   - ACTIONS: Internal measures implemented by the company within its own operations or supply chain
   - SOLUTIONS: Products/services offered to customers that enable sustainability improvements
   - List SOLUTIONS first followed by ACTIONS for each criterion

7. For carbon footprint data, extract with precision:
   - Extract emissions for all years mentioned in the report (current and historical)
   - Pay special attention to scope 1 (direct), 2 (indirect energy), and 3 (value chain) emissions and their breakdowns
   - Note emission reduction targets and timelines
   - Identify emission trends over time (increasing/decreasing)
   - ONLY report values explicitly stated in the document

8. For climate standards and certifications, check for specific mentions:
   - Look for named standards (e.g., ISO 14001, ISO 50001, EMAS, CDP, SBTi)
   - Extract certification status (Yes/No) and year of certification
   - For CDP, note the score (e.g., A, B, C, D)
   - For SBTi, note if targets are short-term or long-term and the temperature pathway (e.g., 1.5°C)
   - Verify certification status is current rather than planned or aspirational

9. When information is missing or unclear:
   - Mark it as "Not found" rather than assuming or inferring
   - NEVER generate placeholder data or make educated guesses
   - If data appears contradictory in different sections, note the discrepancy

10. For website content, focus on sustainability-related information:
    - Examine sustainability, CSR, and ESG-specific pages
    - Check investor relations and annual reports sections
    - Evaluate press releases for recent sustainability initiatives

HALLUCINATION PREVENTION:
1. NEVER extrapolate or infer data beyond what is explicitly stated in the report
2. Do not combine information from different initiatives to create new actions
3. If exact metrics are unavailable, state "No specific metrics provided" rather than estimating
4. If initiatives are mentioned without implementation details, indicate they are "planned" or "in progress"
5. Distinguish between company goals/commitments and actual implemented measures
6. If encountering vague sustainability statements, mark them as "general commitment without specific actions"
7. Avoid including general industry practices unless explicitly mentioned as adopted by the company
8. DO NOT generate content based on industry standards if not explicitly mentioned in the document
9. Always prioritize specificity over comprehensiveness - it's better to extract fewer specific actions than many vague ones
10. Include the exact page number or section where information was found when possible to enhance traceability

Format your response as a single, valid JSON object with the exact structure matching the criteria IDs and following exactly the format from the user's prompt. Do not include backticks, markdown formatting, or any text before or after the JSON.`;
